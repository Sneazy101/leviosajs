# It's LEVIOSA, not leviosaaah!

- This CLI helps you to bundle react components from the terminal. :rocket:

### HOW TO USE

`npm install --global leviosajs`

You're gonna see the following message:

then, in your terminal type in: `accio`

The following message will ask you to type in the name of the component you want:

After you typed the name of your react component and pressed `enter`, it will bundle the component within your project's folder, it will bundle an stateless component 
inside `/src/components` and that's it! :smile:

It doesn't matter if your project doesn't have the `src` folder or the folder `components`. :sunglasses:
