# It's LEVIOSA, not leviosaaah!

- This CLI helps you to bundle reactjs components from the terminal. :rocket:

### HOW TO USE

`npm install --global leviosajs`

You're gonna see the following message: 

[LeviosaJS](./images/postinstallmessage.png)

then, in your terminal type in: `accio`

within your project's folder, it will bundle an stateless component 
inside `/src/components` and that's it! :smile:
